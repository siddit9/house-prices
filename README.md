Thanks for viewing this project!

Using the data from the csv file, I used MySQL to import that data and sort it using SQL queries to answer these data analysis questions:

- What is the price distribution based on the number of bedrooms?
- How many bathrooms are the most common?
- What is the average price of houses with a basement vs no basement?
- Are houses with air conditioning generally larger in area compared to those without?
- What is the correlation between the number of bathrooms and the price of houses?
- How does the number of stories affect the average area and average price?
- How much does parking increase a houseâ€™s price on average?

  Afterwards, I imported the SQL database into PowerBI and visualized the data into a dashboard.
